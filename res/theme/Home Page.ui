    <custom name="text" type="java.lang.String" value="Heroes should be classified as people who have the courage to say what they believe when we lack the courage to say so. In my opinion, people who are brave enough to voice the popular opinion when most don&#x2019;t have the courage to say so are true heroes because they dare to do what most don&#x2019;t. Throughout society and in life, evidence showing that heroes are people who speak up when most don&#x2019;t is pervasive.  	Consider the case of To Kill A Mocking Bird written by Harper Lee set in Alabama in the late 1950&#x2019;s. The story unfolds through the eyes of a young yet precocious Scout Finch who depicts the struggles her father faces as being a lawyer who defends African Americans in the racially segregated South. Scout Finch portrays her father as a man who stands up against injustice and supports the African American community, which had been suppressed for so long. Even though it was considered incorrect for a Caucasian man to defend an African American, Atticus Finch becomes a hero who stands for the suppressed and speaks out against injustice when the others around him don&#x2019;t.  	Now look to the life of Martin Luther King Jr., a man at the forefront of the civil rights movement from 1954-1968.  Dr. King risked his life so that one day America would be a non-segregated and free nation. He facilitated and led rallies and marches, which were often met with harsh violence and suppression. Dr. King broke the silence among the African American community and demanded equality. Martin Luther King Jr. is an American icon and hero, and his efforts clearly demonstrate the idea that those who speak up when most are quiet are heroes.  	Finally, let us take the life of Gandhi, a freedom-fighter who lead the Indian people to Independence in 1946. Gandhi was an educated man who recognized the injustice, which was happening in India. In hopes of living in a free nation, Gandhi vocalized his discontent to the public and rallied others around him towards a vision of a free India. Gandhi raised his voice even though most were silent. His defiance led to the formation of the independence movement in India. He was a hero because he rose up even when those around were firmly down.  	Clearly the above examples show that heroes are people who speak up for something when those around are quiet. Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird exudes this heroic spirit in his stance to defend the African American community in Alabama. Even Gandhi, the man who led India to Independence, is a hero who raised his voice even when those around stood quiet. In society and in life, heroes can be defined as those who are vocal about an opinion, idea, or way of life when those around are unsupportive.  " />
